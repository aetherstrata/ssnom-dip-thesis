  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. It was exactly 300 years ago this month (August 1974) that the 17th century modest draper from Delft, Holland—Antony van Leeuwenhoek—discovered protozoa. Describing them, often with amazing accuracy considering the optical equipment he was using (simply a home-made “glorified”hand lens), in letters to the Royal Society of London, he established himself, certainly, as the founding father of protozoology. It is particularly appropriate for an assemblage of protozoologists to pay homage to this intrepid “philosopher in little things,”a man with an insatiable curiosity about his wee animalcules, on the tricentenary of his discovery of them, since it was an event of such long-lasting significance.},

  abstract = { Leeuwenhoek's 1677 paper, the famous ‘letter on the protozoa’, gives the first detailed description of protists and bacteria living in a range of environments. The colloquial, diaristic style conceals the workings of a startlingly original experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of less than 1 µm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms, interactions and behaviour of his little ‘animalcules', which inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules, where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far from resolved—these questions still challenge our understanding of microbial evolution. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. }

  abstract = {This paper reviews the science of the optical near-field (ONF), which is created and localized in a nanometer-sized material (NM) or on its surface. It is pointed out that work on near-field optics was started in order to break through the diffraction limit in optical microscopy and had already come to an end without giving answers to the essential questions on the origin of the near-field optical interaction. However, recent studies have reincarnated these studies and identified the ONF as an off-shell quantum field. Based on this identification, a novel science called off-shell science has started on the basis that the dispersion relation between energy and momentum is invalid for the ONF. This quantum field is called the dressed photon because it is created as a result of the interaction between photons and electrons (or excitons) in a NM and, thus, it accompanies the energies of electrons or excitons. In reviewing current developments, this paper presents fifteen novel phenomena that are contrary to the common views in conventional optical science. Novel technologies developed by applying these phenomena are also reviewed. These include: nanometer-sized optical devices, nano-fabrication technology, and energy conversion technology. High-power Si light emitting diodes, Si lasers, and SiC polarization rotators are reviewed as examples of electrical to optical energy conversion. For future directions, this paper also reviews novel theoretical studies that have commenced recently by relying on physical and mathematical bases.}

  abstract = {In recent years, a variety of imaging techniques operating at nanoscale resolution have been reported. These techniques have the potential to enrich our understanding of bacterial species relevant to human health, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, owing to the novelty of these techniques, their use is still confined to addressing very particular applications, and their availability is limited owing to associated costs and required expertise. Among these, scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for exploring important optical properties at nanoscale resolution, depending only on the size of a sharp tip. Despite its huge potential to resolve aspects that cannot be tackled otherwise, the penetration of s-SNOM into the life sciences is still proceeding at a slow pace for the aforementioned reasons.In this work we introduce SSNOMBACTER, a set of s-SNOM images collected on 15 bacterial species. These come accompanied by registered Atomic Force Microscopy images, which are useful for placing nanoscale optical information in a relevant topographic context.The proposed dataset aims to augment the popularity of s-SNOM and for accelerating its penetration in life sciences. Furthermore, we consider this dataset to be useful for the development and benchmarking of image analysis tools dedicated to s-SNOM imaging, which are scarce, despite the high need. In this latter context we discuss a series of image processing and analysis applications where SSNOMBACTER could be of help.},

  abstract={The acronym ESKAPE includes six nosocomial pathogens that exhibit multidrug resistance and virulence: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. Persistent use of antibiotics has provoked the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria, which render even the most effective drugs ineffective. Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase producing Gram negative bacteria have emerged as an important therapeutic challenge. Development of novel therapeutics to treat drug resistant infections, especially those caused by ESKAPE pathogens is the need of the hour. Alternative therapies such as use of antibiotics in combination or with adjuvants, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, nanoparticles, and photodynamic light therapy are widely reported. Many reviews published till date describe these therapies with respect to the various agents used, their dosage details and mechanism of action against MDR pathogens but very few have focused specifically on ESKAPE. The objective of this review is to describe the alternative therapies reported to treat ESKAPE infections, their advantages and limitations, potential application in vivo, and status in clinical trials. The review further highlights the importance of a combinatorial approach, wherein two or more therapies are used in combination in order to overcome their individual limitations, additional studies on which are warranted, before translating them into clinical practice. These advances could possibly give an alternate solution or extend the lifetime of current antimicrobials.},

It is known that the presence of fluorophores can influence the dynamics of molecular processes. Despite this, an affordable technique to control the fluorophore distribution within the sample, as well as the rise of unpredictable anomalous processes induced by the fluorophore itself, is missing. We coupled a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope with an atomic force microscope to investigate the formation of amyloid aggregates. In particular, we studied the in vitro aggregation of insulin and two alloforms of β amyloid peptides. We followed standard methods to induce the aggregation and to label the molecules at different dye-to-protein ratios. Only a fraction of the fibrillar aggregates was displayed in STED images, indicating that the labeled molecules did not participate indistinctly to the aggregation process. This finding demonstrates that labeled molecules follow only selected pathways of aggregation, among the multiple that are present in the aggregation reaction.}

	We review Antoni van Leeuwenhoek’s (1632 - 1723) microscopic studies of comparative ocular anatomy in humans, mammals, birds, and fish. His contributions in anatomical microscopy to ocular biology has been overshadowed by his prolific work and first observations of protists and bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, and dental plaque. Leeuwenhoek’s Delftian optical and artisanal heritage more than compensated for any lack of formal scientific training and, in keeping with his Royal Society ethos, shone light onto the “fabric of the eye” in order to better understand its function, which he had extended with his microscopes. He has provided the earliest known microscopic descriptions of the tear film, eyelids, cornea, aqueous, crystalline lens, vitreous, retina, optic nerve, and photoreceptor--as well as the first descriptions of cataract, vitreous floaters, and corneal pathology. His description of the aquatic mammal Cetacean eye foreshadowed an understanding of the optical complexities of aerial and submarine vision of whales. His observations challenged classical teaching at that time, particularly in relation to the optic nerve.}

AFM has advantages in mechanical measurement, including high sensitivity, resolution, accuracy, and simplicity of operation. This paper will introduce the principles of mechanical measurement by using AFM and reviewing the progress of AFM methods in determining frictions in the field of biochemical science over the past decade. While three friction measurement assays—friction morphology, friction curve and friction process in experimental cases—are mainly introduced, important advances of technology, facilitating future development of AFM are also discussed. In addition to the principles and advances, the authors also give an overview of the shortcomings and restrictions of current AFM methods, and propose potential directions of AFM techniques by combining it with other well-established characterization techniques. AFM methods are expected to see an increase in development and attract wide attention in scientific research.},

This was done by scanning a surface in air and correlating scan parameters such as oscillation amplitude and damping with image resolution. We also examined the geometry of the probe with a scanning electron microscope, before and after scanning, in order to determine whether the scanning technique had an effect on the geometry of the probe tip. If the probe is oscillated such that it contacts the surface on each oscillation, substantial damage or “wear” to the probe occurs and significant degradation of image quality was observed. In ambient air, the optimal conditions are achieved when the probe penetrates the contamination layer and reverses direction before touching the surface. Under these “near-contact” conditions no probe damage is observed and high-image resolution can be maintained indefinitely.},

So far, the imaging parameters (i.e., eigenfrequency, stiffness and oscillation amplitude of the cantilever, frequency shift) which result in optimal spatial resolution for a given cantilever and sample have been found empirically. Here, we calculate the optimal set of parameters from first principles as a function of the tip–sample system. The result shows that the either the acquisition rate or the signal-to-noise ratio could be increased by up to two orders of magnitude by using stiffer cantilevers and smaller amplitudes than are in use today.}

	abstract = {A silica optical fiber was imaged using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in both contact and tapping mode. The fiber surface contains fragments of low-modulus, viscoelastic polymer after the coating was mechanically removed. While scanning in the contact mode resulted in tip-induced irreversible damage of the polymer, the tapping mode AFM generated reproducible images of the surface topography. It is shown that tapping mode AFM can reduce the contact force significantly, estimated to be as low as a tenth of a nanonewton, even in ambient conditions. This is facilitated by oscillating the tip (i.e. the cantilever) in the vicinity of the surface with an amplitude of up to ∼ 100 nm, which would eliminate capture of the tip by the surface fluid layer. Since the tip is no longer continuously in contact with the surface, both tip and sample degradations are minimized. The example presented herein demonstrates the utility of the tapping mode AFM; evidence is provided which supports the proposed bonding mechanism at the polymer/silica interface.}

Such samples can be imaged repeatedly by the scanning force microscope without loss of image quality, whereas identical but not immobilized samples are pushed away by the stylus.}

Unfortunately, restricted by the diffraction limit of light, it cannot resolve the nanoscale variation in light absorption and scattering, diagnostics of the local inhomogeneity in material structure and properties. Moreover, a large quantity of nanomaterials has anisotropic optical properties that are appealing yet hard to characterize through conventional optical methods. There is an increasing demand to extend the optical hyperspectral imaging into the nanometer length scale. In this work, we report a super-resolution hyperspectral imaging technique that uses a nanoscale white light source generated by superfocusing the light from a tungsten-halogen lamp to simultaneously obtain optical transmission and scattering spectroscopic images. A 6-nm spatial resolution in the visible to near-infrared wavelength regime (415--980{\thinspace}nm) is demonstrated on an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (SW-CNT). Both the longitudinal and transverse optical electronic transitions are measured, and the SW-CNT chiral indices can be identified. The band structure modulation in a SW-CNT through strain engineering is mapped.},

Many of the attractive features of conventional optics are retained, including noninvasiveness, reliability, and low cost. In addition, most optical contrast mechanisms can be extended to the near-field regime, resulting in a technique of considerable versatility. This versatility is demonstrated by several examples, such as the imaging of nanometric-scale features in mammalian tissue sections and the creation of ultrasmall, magneto-optic domains having implications for highdensity data storage. Although the technique may find uses in many diverse fields, two of the most exciting possibilities are localized optical spectroscopy of semiconductors and the fluorescence imaging of living cells.}

The finite coating and optical fiber end are now taken into account. The new features enable us to simulate the near-field probes that are widely used in the collection mode SNOM. The emphases of the numerical analyses have been mainly on the resolution mechanism of the microscopy. Influence on the resolution from important parameters of the probe tips, such as the size of the apertures and the probe-sample distance, is extensively studied.

To resolve this problem, a novel analytical model is presented here. The comparison with experimental data demonstrates that the model quantitatively reproduces approach curves on a Au surface and yields an unprecedented agreement with amplitude and phase spectra recorded on a phonon-polariton resonant SiC sample. The simple closed-form solution derived here should enable the determination of the local complex dielectric function on an unknown sample, thereby identifying its nanoscale chemical composition, crystal structure and conductivity.},

	abstract = {A coupled-dipole approach is proposed in order to study the coupling between the probe tip and the rough sample in SNOM. In the present model both the optical probe tip and the sample protrusions are represented by polarizable dipole spheres. The induced polarization effects on the sample surface can be replaced by the image dipoles in the circumstance of quasi-static electromagnetic field approximation. Applying the radiation theory of the dipole, we have established a set of self-consistent equations to describe the field distribution at the sites of the probe tip and the sample protrusions. The results are completely the same as those obtained by means of the dyadic electromagnetic propagator formalism and also the derivation procedure is relatively simple. This method permits us to analyze the physical mechanisms of the interaction between the probe tip and the rough surface in SNOM intuitively. Based on this approach, we further discuss the influence of polarization of the incident light on the imaging quality. The calculating result shows that the shape and the contrast of the images of the sample are both sensitive to the field polarization, and the z-polarized mode is proved to give better resolution in SNOM.}

However, the observed spectral redshift cannot be explained by the conventional near-field thermal radiation model based on the point dipole approximation. In the present work, a heated tip is modeled as randomly fluctuating point charges (or fluctuating finite dipoles) aligned along the primary axis of a prolate spheroid, and quasistatic tip-substrate charge interactions are considered to formulate the effective polarizability and self-interaction Green's function. The finite dipole model (FDM), combined with fluctuational electrodynamics, allows the computation of tip-plane thermal radiation in the extreme near-field (i.e., H/R≲1, where H is the tip-substrate gap distance and R is the tip radius), which cannot be calculated with the point dipole approximation. The FDM provides the underlying physics on the spectral redshift of tip-scattered near-field thermal radiation as observed in experiments. In addition, the SPhP peak in the near-field thermal radiation spectrum may split into two peaks as the gap distance decreases into the extreme near-field regime. This observation suggests that scattering-type spectroscopic measurements may not convey the full spectral features of tip-plane extreme near-field thermal radiation.}

However, at this moment the intersections between ASNOM and the realm of bioimaging are scarce, mainly due to data interpretation difficulties linked to the limited body of work performed so far in this field and hence the reduced volume of supporting information. We propose an imaging approach that holds significant potential for alleviating this issue, consisting of correlative imaging of biological specimens using a multimodal system that incorporates ASNOM and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which allows placing near-field data into a well understood context of anatomical relevance. We demonstrate this approach on zebrafish retinal tissue. The proposed method holds important implications for the in-depth understanding of biological items through the prism of ASNOM and CLSM data complementarity.},

The oldest beneficial microbial infections are the ancient eukaryotic organelles now called the mitochondrion and plastid.

The genomes of host-beneficial intracellular bacteria have features that span a previously unfilled gap between pathogens and organelles.

During the late nineteenth century, when Pasteur and Koch were developing the germ theory of disease, a pathogen was simply defined as a microorganism that was capable of causing disease in a host (only human hosts will be considered in this book). Pioneers in the burgeoning field of clinical microbiology showed that life-threatening diseases such as anthrax, diphtheria, tetanus, and tuberculosis were caused by single bacterial pathogens. These so-called primary pathogens were capable of causing unique disease symptoms in a healthy host, as defined by the satisfactory fulfillment of Koch's Postulates. In addition, macromolecular factors (e.g., exotoxins, endotoxin, capsules) were shown to be responsible for inducing these specific disease symptoms. These so-called virulence factors were thought to be inherently present in pathogenic bacteria but not present in nonpathogenic bacteria.},

Interestingly, there seems to be a correlation between the shape of an organism and its set of penicillin-binding proteins – the enzymes that assemble the peptidoglycan, the main constituent of the cell wall. While only one peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery seems to exist in staphylococci, two of these machineries are proposed to function in ovoid-shaped bacteria, reinforcing the intrinsic differences regarding the morphogenesis of different classes of cocci.

	Bacterial pathogens employ a number of genetic strategies to cause infection and, occasionally, disease in their hosts. Many of these virulence factors and their regulatory elements can be divided into a smaller number of groups based on the conservation of similar mechanisms. These common themes are found throughout bacterial virulence factors. For example, there are only a few general types of toxins, despite a large number of host targets. Similarly, there are only a few conserved ways to build the bacterial pilus and nonpilus adhesins used by pathogens to adhere to host substrates. Bacterial entry into host cells (invasion) is a complex mechanism. However, several common invasion themes exist in diverse microorganisms. Similarly, once inside a host cell, pathogens have a limited number of ways to ensure their survival, whether remaining within a host vacuole or by escaping into the cytoplasm. Avoidance of the host immune defenses is key to the success of a pathogen. Several common themes again are employed, including antigenic variation, camouflage by binding host molecules, and enzymatic degradation of host immune components. Most virulence factors are found on the bacterial surface or secreted into their immediate environment, yet virulence factors operate through a relatively small number of microbial secretion systems. The expression of bacterial pathogenicity is dependent upon complex regulatory circuits. However, pathogens use only a small number of biochemical families to express distinct functional factors at the appropriate time that causes infection. Finally, virulence factors maintained on mobile genetic elements and pathogenicity islands ensure that new strains of pathogens evolve constantly. Comprehension of these common themes in microbial pathogenicity is critical to the understanding and study of bacterial virulence mechanisms and to the development of new "anti-virulence" agents, which are so desperately needed to replace antibiotics.}

When a bacterium, attached to a cell surface, is exposed to external forces, the pili, which are composed of ∼103 PapA protein subunits arranged in a helical conformation, can elongate by unfolding to a linear conformation. This property is considered important for the ability of a bacterium to withstand shear forces caused by urine flow. It has hitherto been assumed that this elongation is plastic, thus constituting a permanent conformational deformation. We demonstrate, using optical tweezers, that this is not the case; the unfolding of the helical structure to a linear conformation is fully reversible. It is surmised that this reversibility helps the bacteria regain close contact to the host cells after exposure to significant shear forces, which is believed to facilitate their colonization.},

A two-dimensional analysis of the signal provided by the data acquisition system makes it possible to obtain phase maps over the whole \[0, 2$\pi$) range. This requires post-processing of the data to select the best coordinate system in which to represent the data along the direction of maximum variance. The analysis also provides a quantitative parameter describing how much of the total variance is included within the component selected for calculation of the modulus and phase of the near field. The dependence of the pseudo-heterodyne phase on the mean position of the reference mirror is analyzed, and the evolution of the global phase is extracted from the s-SNOM data. The results obtained from this technique compared well with the expected maps of the near-field phase obtained from simulations.},

The availability of these agents rapidly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with a host of formerly fatal diseases. In addition, the confidence that infections could be prevented or treated by antibiotics allowed major leaps forward in the treatment of noninfectious diseases, including serious heart disease, cancers, and organ failure requiring transplants. Medical care, as we now know it, could not exist without the availability of effective antibioticsThe widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with what we now know to be the predictable emergence of resistance. Early confidence that infections would eventually be conquered has given way to a greater appreciation of the genetic flexibility of common human pathogens. Moreover, we have come to appreciate the role played by microorganisms in our homeostasis. Microorganisms are an intrinsic part of us, and we would do well to learn to live with them},

	abstract = {This study introduces a machine-learning approach to enhance signal-to-noise ratios in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). While s-SNOM offers a high spatial resolution, its effectiveness is often hindered by low signal levels, particularly in weakly absorbing samples. To address these challenges, we utilize a data-driven “patch-based” machine learning reconstruction method, incorporating modern generative adversarial neural networks (CycleGANs) for denoising s-SNOM images. This method allows for flexible reconstruction of images of arbitrary sizes, a critical capability given the variable nature of scanned sample areas in point-scanning probe-based microscopies. The CycleGAN model is trained on unpaired sets of images captured at both rapid and extended acquisition times, thereby modeling instrument noise while preserving essential topographical and molecular information. The results show significant improvements in image quality, as indicated by higher structural similarity index and peak signal-to-noise ratio values, comparable to those obtained from images captured with four times the integration time. This method not only enhances image quality but also has the potential to reduce the overall data acquisition time, making high-resolution s-SNOM imaging more feasible for a wide range of biological and materials science applications.},

The median operation is nonlinear. As such, the running median does not possess the superposition property and traditional impulse response analysis is not strictly applicable. The impulse response of a median smoother is, in fact, zero for all time. Consequently, alternative methods for analyzing and characterizing running medians must be employed.}

It is based on a two-scale decomposition of the image into a base layer, encoding large-scale variations, and a detail layer. Only the base layer has its contrast reduced, thereby preserving detail. The base layer is obtained using an edge-preserving filter called the bilateral filter. This is a non-linear filter, where the weight of each pixel is computed using a Gaussian in the spatial domain multiplied by an influence function in the intensity domain that decreases the weight of pixels with large intensity differences. We express bilateral filtering in the framework of robust statistics and show how it relates to anisotropic diffusion. We then accelerate bilateral filtering by using a piecewise-linear approximation in the intensity domain and appropriate subsampling. This results in a speed-up of two orders of magnitude. The method is fast and requires no parameter setting.},

For this purpose, experiments have been conducted to find the optimum parameters for different noise levels. Besides, the filter has been adapted to fit with specific characteristics of the noise in MR image magnitude images (i.e. Rician noise). From the results over synthetic and real images we can conclude that this filter can be successfully used for automatic MR denoising.}

	abstract={The S{\o}rensen-Dice index (SDI) is a widely used measure for evaluating medical image segmentation algorithms. It offers a standardized measure of segmentation accuracy which has proven useful. However, it offers diminishing insight when the number of objects is unknown, such as in white matter lesion segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We present a refinement for finer grained parsing of SDI results in situations where the number of objects is unknown. We explore these ideas with two case studies showing what can be learned from our two presented studies. Our first study explores an inter-rater comparison, showing that smaller lesions cannot be reliably identified. In our second case study, we demonstrate fusing multiple MS lesion segmentation algorithms based on the insights into the algorithms provided by our analysis to generate a segmentation that exhibits improved performance. This work demonstrates the wealth of information that can be learned from refined analysis of medical image segmentations.},

	modalities and has the potential to improve determination of
	target volume in radiotherapy planning. This paper describes the
	implementation and validation of a 3D fully automated
	registration procedure in the process of radiotherapy treatment

	tumors received computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
	(MR) brain imaging before the start of radiotherapy. First, the
	normalized mutual information (NMI) method was used for image
	registration. Registration accuracy was estimated by performing
	statistical analysis of coordinate differences between CT and MR
	anatomical landmarks along the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes. Second, a
	visual validation protocol was developed to validate the quality
	of individual registration solutions, and this protocol was
	tested in a series of 36 CT‐MR registration procedures with
	intentionally applied registration errors. The mean coordinate
	differences between CT and MR landmarks along the x‐ and y‐axes
	were in general within 0.5 mm. The mean coordinate differences
	along the z‐axis were within 1.0 mm, which is of the same
	magnitude as the applied slice thickness in scanning. In
	addition, the detection of intentionally applied registration
	errors by employment of a standardized visual validation
	protocol resulted in low false‐negative and low false‐positive
	rates. Application of the NMI method for the brain results in
	excellent automatic registration accuracy, and the method has
	been incorporated into the daily routine at our institution. A
	standardized validation protocol ensures the quality of
	individual registrations by detecting registration errors with
	high sensitivity and specificity. This protocol is proposed for
	the validation of other linear registration methods. PACS

	abstract  = {PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of registration of MRI and
	CT datasets post permanent prostate implant by the use of mutual
	information. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five patients who underwent
	permanent (125)I implant for prostate carcinoma were studied.
	Two weeks postimplant an axial CT, T2-weighted-axial, sagittal
	and coronal MRI, and T1-fat-saturation MRI scans were obtained.
	Registrations of MRI to CT and MRI to MRI datasets were
	performed by mutual information, an automated process of data
	registration matching all information in specified dataset
	regions of interest. Registration quality was evaluated by
	visual inspection, agreement with seed- to-seed registration,
	and histogram analysis. RESULTS: Rapid registration (<30
	minutes) of CT and MRI datasets can be accomplished through the
	use of mutual information. All methods of registration
	evaluation confirmed excellent registration quality. Although
	D90 and V100 for the prostate were comparable between MRI- and
	CT-based dosimetry, dose to critical
	structures/microenvironments (anterior base, posterior base,
	bladder outlet, lower sphincter, bulbar urethra) defined on MRI
	varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient and accurate registration
	of MRI and CT datasets following prostate implant is possible,
	and improves the accuracy of postimplant dosimetry by superior
	definition of the prostate. Definition of critical
	microenvironments and adjacent structures will improve dose and
	toxicity correlation and ultimately improve planning strategies.},

	abstract = { This paper presents a simple and biologically plausible model of how mammalian visual systems could detect and identify features in an image. We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as ‘lines’ and ‘edges’ are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points ‘local energy’ is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90°: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images. }

	 abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An adaptive window length Recursive Weighted Median filter [ARWMF] for removing the impulse noise with better edge and ¯ne detail preservation is presented. Larger window size may blur the images and the lower window size does not remove the noise at high density. To overcome this, the window size of the RWMF is adaptive based on the presence of noise density. Median controlled algorithm is used to calculate the weights for the RWMF. In median controlled algorithm, the ¯lter gives the smallest weight for the impulse. However, for many weight functions, including the exponential one, this weight is non-zero. Thus the impulse has an effect on the output and the magnitude of the impulse is reduced. The computational complexity for the weight calculation is simple and it is very efficient. The window size of the RWMF is adaptive based on the presence of noise density. The proposed algorithm produces better edge and fine details preservations and reduces blurring at the high density impulse noise.The performance of the proposed algorithm is given in terms of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and it is compared with Standard Median ¯lters, Weighted Median filters, Center Weighted Median ¯lters, Recursive Weighted Median filters and Lins Adaptive length Recursive weighted median filters using Median Controlled Algorithm.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

	abstract={Object detection or localization is an incremental step in progression from coarse to fine digital image inference. It not only provides the classes of the image objects, but also provides the location of the image objects which have been classified. The location is given in the form of bounding boxes or centroids. Semantic segmentation gives fine inference by predicting labels for every pixel in the input image. Each pixel is labelled according to the object class within which it is enclosed. Furthering this evolution, instance segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects belonging to the same class. Hence, instance segmentation may be defined as the technique of simultaneously solving the problem of object detection as well as that of semantic segmentation. In this survey paper on instance segmentation, its background, issues, techniques, evolution, popular datasets, related work up to the state of the art and future scope have been discussed. The paper provides valuable information for those who want to do research in the field of instance segmentation.},
