  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. It was exactly 300 years ago this month (August 1974) that the 17th century modest draper from Delft, Holland—Antony van Leeuwenhoek—discovered protozoa. Describing them, often with amazing accuracy considering the optical equipment he was using (simply a home-made “glorified”hand lens), in letters to the Royal Society of London, he established himself, certainly, as the founding father of protozoology. It is particularly appropriate for an assemblage of protozoologists to pay homage to this intrepid “philosopher in little things,”a man with an insatiable curiosity about his wee animalcules, on the tricentenary of his discovery of them, since it was an event of such long-lasting significance.},

  abstract = { Leeuwenhoek's 1677 paper, the famous ‘letter on the protozoa’, gives the first detailed description of protists and bacteria living in a range of environments. The colloquial, diaristic style conceals the workings of a startlingly original experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of less than 1 µm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms, interactions and behaviour of his little ‘animalcules', which inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules, where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far from resolved—these questions still challenge our understanding of microbial evolution. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. }

  abstract = {This paper reviews the science of the optical near-field (ONF), which is created and localized in a nanometer-sized material (NM) or on its surface. It is pointed out that work on near-field optics was started in order to break through the diffraction limit in optical microscopy and had already come to an end without giving answers to the essential questions on the origin of the near-field optical interaction. However, recent studies have reincarnated these studies and identified the ONF as an off-shell quantum field. Based on this identification, a novel science called off-shell science has started on the basis that the dispersion relation between energy and momentum is invalid for the ONF. This quantum field is called the dressed photon because it is created as a result of the interaction between photons and electrons (or excitons) in a NM and, thus, it accompanies the energies of electrons or excitons. In reviewing current developments, this paper presents fifteen novel phenomena that are contrary to the common views in conventional optical science. Novel technologies developed by applying these phenomena are also reviewed. These include: nanometer-sized optical devices, nano-fabrication technology, and energy conversion technology. High-power Si light emitting diodes, Si lasers, and SiC polarization rotators are reviewed as examples of electrical to optical energy conversion. For future directions, this paper also reviews novel theoretical studies that have commenced recently by relying on physical and mathematical bases.}

  abstract = {In recent years, a variety of imaging techniques operating at nanoscale resolution have been reported. These techniques have the potential to enrich our understanding of bacterial species relevant to human health, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, owing to the novelty of these techniques, their use is still confined to addressing very particular applications, and their availability is limited owing to associated costs and required expertise. Among these, scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for exploring important optical properties at nanoscale resolution, depending only on the size of a sharp tip. Despite its huge potential to resolve aspects that cannot be tackled otherwise, the penetration of s-SNOM into the life sciences is still proceeding at a slow pace for the aforementioned reasons.In this work we introduce SSNOMBACTER, a set of s-SNOM images collected on 15 bacterial species. These come accompanied by registered Atomic Force Microscopy images, which are useful for placing nanoscale optical information in a relevant topographic context.The proposed dataset aims to augment the popularity of s-SNOM and for accelerating its penetration in life sciences. Furthermore, we consider this dataset to be useful for the development and benchmarking of image analysis tools dedicated to s-SNOM imaging, which are scarce, despite the high need. In this latter context we discuss a series of image processing and analysis applications where SSNOMBACTER could be of help.},

  abstract={The acronym ESKAPE includes six nosocomial pathogens that exhibit multidrug resistance and virulence: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. Persistent use of antibiotics has provoked the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria, which render even the most effective drugs ineffective. Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase producing Gram negative bacteria have emerged as an important therapeutic challenge. Development of novel therapeutics to treat drug resistant infections, especially those caused by ESKAPE pathogens is the need of the hour. Alternative therapies such as use of antibiotics in combination or with adjuvants, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, nanoparticles, and photodynamic light therapy are widely reported. Many reviews published till date describe these therapies with respect to the various agents used, their dosage details and mechanism of action against MDR pathogens but very few have focused specifically on ESKAPE. The objective of this review is to describe the alternative therapies reported to treat ESKAPE infections, their advantages and limitations, potential application in vivo, and status in clinical trials. The review further highlights the importance of a combinatorial approach, wherein two or more therapies are used in combination in order to overcome their individual limitations, additional studies on which are warranted, before translating them into clinical practice. These advances could possibly give an alternate solution or extend the lifetime of current antimicrobials.},

It is known that the presence of fluorophores can influence the dynamics of molecular processes. Despite this, an affordable technique to control the fluorophore distribution within the sample, as well as the rise of unpredictable anomalous processes induced by the fluorophore itself, is missing. We coupled a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope with an atomic force microscope to investigate the formation of amyloid aggregates. In particular, we studied the in vitro aggregation of insulin and two alloforms of β amyloid peptides. We followed standard methods to induce the aggregation and to label the molecules at different dye-to-protein ratios. Only a fraction of the fibrillar aggregates was displayed in STED images, indicating that the labeled molecules did not participate indistinctly to the aggregation process. This finding demonstrates that labeled molecules follow only selected pathways of aggregation, among the multiple that are present in the aggregation reaction.}

	We review Antoni van Leeuwenhoek’s (1632 - 1723) microscopic studies of comparative ocular anatomy in humans, mammals, birds, and fish. His contributions in anatomical microscopy to ocular biology has been overshadowed by his prolific work and first observations of protists and bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, and dental plaque. Leeuwenhoek’s Delftian optical and artisanal heritage more than compensated for any lack of formal scientific training and, in keeping with his Royal Society ethos, shone light onto the “fabric of the eye” in order to better understand its function, which he had extended with his microscopes. He has provided the earliest known microscopic descriptions of the tear film, eyelids, cornea, aqueous, crystalline lens, vitreous, retina, optic nerve, and photoreceptor--as well as the first descriptions of cataract, vitreous floaters, and corneal pathology. His description of the aquatic mammal Cetacean eye foreshadowed an understanding of the optical complexities of aerial and submarine vision of whales. His observations challenged classical teaching at that time, particularly in relation to the optic nerve.}

	ABSTRACT = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an analytical nanotechnology in friction determination between microscale and nanoscale surfaces. AFM has advantages in mechanical measurement, including high sensitivity, resolution, accuracy, and simplicity of operation. This paper will introduce the principles of mechanical measurement by using AFM and reviewing the progress of AFM methods in determining frictions in the field of biochemical science over the past decade. While three friction measurement assays—friction morphology, friction curve and friction process in experimental cases—are mainly introduced, important advances of technology, facilitating future development of AFM are also discussed. In addition to the principles and advances, the authors also give an overview of the shortcomings and restrictions of current AFM methods, and propose potential directions of AFM techniques by combining it with other well-established characterization techniques. AFM methods are expected to see an increase in development and attract wide attention in scientific research.},

	abstract = {Abstract We have operated an atomic force microscope in ambient air with several oscillating cantilever modes to establish the optimal scanning parameters to maximize image resolution and to minimize probe and sample damage. This was done by scanning a surface in air and correlating scan parameters such as oscillation amplitude and damping with image resolution. We also examined the geometry of the probe with a scanning electron microscope, before and after scanning, in order to determine whether the scanning technique had an effect on the geometry of the probe tip. If the probe is oscillated such that it contacts the surface on each oscillation, substantial damage or “wear” to the probe occurs and significant degradation of image quality was observed. In ambient air, the optimal conditions are achieved when the probe penetrates the contamination layer and reverses direction before touching the surface. Under these “near-contact” conditions no probe damage is observed and high-image resolution can be maintained indefinitely.},

	abstract = {True atomic resolution of conductors and insulators is now routinely obtained in vacuum by frequency modulation atomic force microscopy. So far, the imaging parameters (i.e., eigenfrequency, stiffness and oscillation amplitude of the cantilever, frequency shift) which result in optimal spatial resolution for a given cantilever and sample have been found empirically. Here, we calculate the optimal set of parameters from first principles as a function of the tip–sample system. The result shows that the either the acquisition rate or the signal-to-noise ratio could be increased by up to two orders of magnitude by using stiffer cantilevers and smaller amplitudes than are in use today.}

	abstract = {A silica optical fiber was imaged using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in both contact and tapping mode. The fiber surface contains fragments of low-modulus, viscoelastic polymer after the coating was mechanically removed. While scanning in the contact mode resulted in tip-induced irreversible damage of the polymer, the tapping mode AFM generated reproducible images of the surface topography. It is shown that tapping mode AFM can reduce the contact force significantly, estimated to be as low as a tenth of a nanonewton, even in ambient conditions. This is facilitated by oscillating the tip (i.e. the cantilever) in the vicinity of the surface with an amplitude of up to ∼ 100 nm, which would eliminate capture of the tip by the surface fluid layer. Since the tip is no longer continuously in contact with the surface, both tip and sample degradations are minimized. The example presented herein demonstrates the utility of the tapping mode AFM; evidence is provided which supports the proposed bonding mechanism at the polymer/silica interface.}

To this end samples have to be fixed to a flat solid support so that they cannot be displaced by the scanning tip. Here we describe a method to achieve the covalent binding of biological samples to glass surfaces. Coverslips were chemically modified with the photoactivatable cross-linker N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide. Samples are squeezed between derivatized coverslips and then cross-linked to the glass surface by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Such samples can be imaged repeatedly by the scanning force microscope without loss of image quality, whereas identical but not immobilized samples are pushed away by the stylus.}
